1. Assume the robot is on intersection (1, 5) facing north.
   There is a Wall immediately in front of it.
    a) true
    b) true
    c) false
    d) false
    e) false
    f) true
    g) true

2. The two statements will give you the same outcome. This is because the first one is asking
if karel can pick up something turn right, if he can not turn left. Statement two say the inverse
but then switches the turning therefor making it the same. It says if karel can not pick up something
turn left, if he can turn right. They are the same.
